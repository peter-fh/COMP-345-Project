Dice.h
Dice.cpp
The dice function has a main program that prompts the user for an input of the amount of dices, type of dice and modifier. It then rolls the dice based on this function, outputting the sum of the rolls. It also includes the dice class which provides constructors that allow for dice objects with a specified amount of faces, the function checks if the amount of faces are valid and if not returns a 0 faces die. These dices have an overloaded roll function, where a default roll will give you a random number in your dice range, you can also specify an amount of rolls and a different dice type.
